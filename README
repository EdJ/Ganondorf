Ganondorf is a C# library (with accompanying Unit- and Performance- tests) designed to make serialising objects to and from the query string less arduous.

It is targeted at .net 4, utilises the ILGenerator and DynamicMethods to make serialisation comparable to rolling your own conversion methods from a speed perspective.

Known issues:
  - Sub-objects that are null cause the dynamic method to thrown a NullReferenceException.
  - Objects with recursive definitions cannot be serialised.
  - Compiling to platforms other than MSIL cause an "Attempt to read or write protected memory" issue.
