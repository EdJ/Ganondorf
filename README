Ganondorf is a C# library (with accompanying Integration- and Performance- tests) designed to make serialising objects to and from the query string less arduous.

It is targeted at .net 4, utilises the ILGenerator and DynamicMethods to make serialisation comparable to rolling your own conversion methods from a speed perspective.

Known issues:
  - Sub-objects that are null cause the dynamic method to thrown a NullReferenceException (see failing integration test).
  - Objects with recursive definitions cannot be serialised correctly.
  - Attempting to run on an x64 machine when part of the project is targeted to x86 causes a protected memory error (need to verify the inverse).
